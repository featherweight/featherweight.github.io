## Simplifying Terms

This section is not legal advice (legal advice comes from your counsel).

This section is intended to help you as you consider using Featherweight: Application Framework for LabVIEW™ code,
or referencing the documentation in 

### Using the Framework

The code itself aims to be as accessible as possible, both for
learning and enterprise, to promote the success of applications
designed and developed using graphical programming.

For this reason, the `MIT license` below was chosen at the time of
writing for best suiting these goals and being widely recognized
and accepted: [#ftw-framework-license]

Bottom line: it's likely OK for you to use the code for your application, even
as a proprietary fork or for-profit business endeavor, and you only must
include with your distributable the original license: [#ftw-framework-license]

Ask your counsel if you are unsure or have additional questions.

### Referencing the Documentation 

The online documentation and ideas expressed on this site have a
different license than the codebase: [#ftw-docs-license]

The spirit is to allow contributors to Featherweight to retain
individual attribution to neat ideas while still freely contributing.

Examples:

If you are preparing a presentation or writing a forum response, it is
sufficient attribution to provide a fully-qualified URL and anchored
link to the referenced documentation. You might consider crediting
the authors by name where appropriate.

When referencing content, one is encouraged to provide a direct URI
to the original documentation (either online, or a URI to an offline
clone of the repository) rather than copy-and-pasting portions.

### Redistribution

If you create something using Featherweight, then give that thing to
somebody, give them this license at the same time: [#ftw-framework-license]

Include the license as appropriate to your distributable and accessible
to the end-user, such as inside a `/legal` or `/licenses` directory
alongside the distributable, or as text in an "About" dialogue.
It is permissible to modify CRLF whitespace to fit word-wrapping boundaries
of text containers, but the license must remain otherwise unmodified.

## Acknowledgements

This website is based on the generous and most excellent work of
the people who made Jekyll.

Featherweight has no connection to National Instruments, owner of
the NI LabVIEW™ trademark, and many worldwide patents on their
contributions to graphical programming.
